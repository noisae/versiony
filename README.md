versiony
========

Node.js module to increment version number for your code/module

Usage:
-----

Versiony can read code versions from json files containing either the keys "major", "minor", "patch"
```js
    {
        "major": 0,
        "minor": 1,
        "patch": 1
    }
```

or with a "version" key, just like package.json

```js
    {
        "name": "versiony",
        "version": "0.1.1"
    }
```

Example

version.json
```js
    {
        "major": 0,
        "minor": 0,
        "patch": 1
    }
```

test.js
```js
var versiony = require('./index')

versiony

    .minor()                //will cause the minor version to be bumped by 1
    .from('version.json')   //read the version from version.json
    .to()                   //write the version to the source file (package.json)
                            //with the minor part bumped by 1
    .to('bower.json')       //apply the same version
    .to('package.json')     //apply the same version
    .end()                  //display info on the stdout about modified files
```

The above code will cause the version 0.1.1 to be written to all 3 files, if all are found.

In the case ```versiony``` does not find a file that is specified in the ```to()``` call, it just skips it.

Other examples
------------

Set the patch version number to 4. That is, for a current version 1.0.2 will write 1.0.4

```js
    versiony
        .from('package.json')
        .patch(4)
        .to()
```


Take the version in version.json. For this version, set the major version to 1, then write this to package.json and bower.json. So, for version.json containing "4.5.6" the script below will write 1.5.6 to package.json and bower.json. If you also want to update version.json, simply add a .to() call anywhere after the major(1)

```js
    versiony
        .from('version.json')
        .major(1)
        .to('package.json')
        .to('bower.json')
        .end()
```

Copy the version from one file to another

```js
    versiony.from('version.json').to('package.json')
```

Release a new major version
```js
    versiony
        .from('version.json')
            .major()
            .minor(0)
            .patch(0)
        .to()               //also write to the source file (the one specified in from() )
        .to('bower.json')
        .to('package.json')
        .end()
```

Which is equivalent to
```js
    versiony
        .from('version.json')
        .newMajor()
        .to()
        .to('bower.json')
        .to('package.json')
        .end()
```

The flow in the above script is the following

 - take the version from version.json
 - apply the modifications (increment major, set minor and patch to 0)
 - write the new version to the source file (version.json)
 - write the new version to bower.json
 - write the new version to package.json


API
===

## major()

Causes the current major version to be incremented by 1

## major(value)

Sets the current major version to have the specified value

## minor()

Causes the current minor version to be incremented by 1

## minor(value)

Sets the current minor version to have the specified value

## patch()

Causes the current patch version to be incremented by 1

## patch(value)

Sets the current patch version to have the specified value

Calling major() twice does not cause the increment to be applied twice. It is only applied once. Same for minor() and patch()

## newMajor

Equivalent to calling major().minor(0).patch(0)

## from(file)

Sets the current version. This clears any values set using major(value), minor(value) and patch(value). It does not clear increments set with (major(), minor() and patch()

## with(file)

Same as from(file), but also writes the version back to file, if previously increments have been used.

Example - increment the major version

```js
    require('versiony')
        .major()
        .with('package.json')
```

## to(json_file)

Causes the version to be written to the specified file. If the specified json file has a "version" key, the version will be written to that key. If it has "major", "minor" and "patch" keys, the value will be written to those.

## to()

Writes the value to the source file (the file that was used with .from() or .with() ). If no initial file specified, it simply returns.

## version(v: String/Array)

Sets the current version. This clears any value set using major(value), minor(value), patch(value), as well as their incrementive forms ( major(), minor(), patch() )

Example: sets version 4.0.0

```js
    versiony
        .major()
        .version('4.0.0')
        .to('package.json')
```
is equivalent to
```js
    versiony
        .version('4.0.0')
        .to('package.json')
```

## end()

Clears any version and outputs the files that have been updated. Calling it is totally optional.
